HTML5 game engine. Still in a very early stage. I'm making this to improve my programming skill. I'm not trying to compete with other HTML5 game engines out there. Initially, I was just trying to draw some tiles on canvas. Then, I added more and more features until I decided to create a game with it.

##Features
* Movements are alligned to grid (suitable for puzzle games such as Sokoban)
* Speech bubbles
* Inventory system (in progress)
* Shopping system (planned)
